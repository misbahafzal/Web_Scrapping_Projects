# Web_Scrapping_Projects
Data Collection is a crucial step in data science life cycle which is executed after answering research questions e.g. what kind of data is required to find solution for the problem we are working on. So, as part of data collection stage, I did some practice projects and scrapped data from multiple websites and transformed it into presentable format or into database per requirements. I have used python webscrapping libraries e.g. **requests, beautifulsoup** etc.
